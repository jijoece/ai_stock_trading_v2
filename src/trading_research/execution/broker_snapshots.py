"""Framework-neutral broker submission/account/position snapshots for the
credentialed paper-broker path (docs/milestone-4.md Step 8/10).

These are new, additive contracts — nothing in `execution/models.py` (the
Milestone 3 contracts) is modified. `BrokerOrderSubmission` tracks the
submission/idempotency state machine across the main-process/runtime
boundary; `BrokerAccountSnapshot`/`BrokerPositionSnapshot` are the read
side used by account/position reconciliation.

# Submission/order lifecycle across the process boundary (docs/milestone-
# 4.md Step 8). `PENDING_SUBMISSION` and `SUBMISSION_UNKNOWN` are new states
# that do not exist in Milestone 3's synchronous `PaperExecutionResult`
# (docs/milestone-3.md's adapter.submit() always returns a resolved
# outcome) — a real broker submission is asynchronous, so this state
# machine tracks the interval between "we asked the broker" and "we know
# what happened."
#
# PR 9: these are no longer independent literals. They are the runtime
# normalization contract (`runtime/normalization.py`), which the isolated
# `trading_paper_runtime` distribution declares identically.
#
# The pre-PR-9 literals omitted `CANCEL_REQUESTED` and `EXPIRED`, both of
# which `lumibot_gateway._ALPACA_STATUS_MAP` can emit (Alpaca
# `pending_cancel` and `expired`). Because `update_submission_status` writes
# the status unvalidated while `_row_to_submission` reads it back through
# this dataclass, one expired or cancel-pending broker order wrote a row
# that `get_submission`/`list_unresolved_submissions` could never read
# again. `EXPIRED` is terminal; `CANCEL_REQUESTED` is not.
