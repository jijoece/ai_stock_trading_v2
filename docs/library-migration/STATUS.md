# Migration Status

**Current phase: PR 2 — complete.**
**Next phase: PR 3 — exchange_calendars migration.**

## Completed work (PR 0)

- Targeted repository inventory across infra, backtesting/accounting, and
  trading/signals/safety (three parallel read-only agents; see
  `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `COMPONENT_MATRIX.md` for the consolidated result).
- Dependency-compatibility research against live PyPI/GitHub data for the
  library candidates evaluated (see `DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md` Section 1, 23
  table entries — the earlier "21 proposed libraries" figure did not match
  the table and has been corrected here rather than repeated).
- ADR reconciliation for the two direct conflicts between the original
  `docs/milestones/rebuild/plan.md` and accepted ADRs 0001 and 0006 (see
  `DECISIONS.md` D1/D2). Neither required a superseding ADR — both were
  resolved by narrowing scope rather than overriding the original decision.
- Revised PR sequence (`MASTER_PLAN.md`), removal manifest
  (`REMOVAL_MANIFEST.md`), and preservation manifest
  (`PRESERVATION_MANIFEST.md`).

## Completed work (PR 1)

**Scope:** `pyproject.toml`, `paper_runtime/pyproject.toml`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `docs/adr/0002-isolated-lumibot-runtime.md`
(one amendment section), one doc-comment-only edit in
`tests/unit/test_lumibot_adapter.py` (no behavior change — see "Root
`paper` extra removed" below), and the `docs/library-migration/*`
documentation set — not `pyproject.toml` only, and not limited to
dependency declarations; PR 1 also corrected inaccurate planning guidance
recorded during PR 0 and, after review, removed an unresolvable install
target and added CI coverage for the new extras and the Python floor.

### Dependencies added

Base dependencies (`pyproject.toml`, not an extra):

```text
exchange_calendars>=4.13,<5
```

New `indicators` extra:

```text
TA-Lib>=0.7.1,<0.8
```

New `analytics` extra:

```text
empyrical-reloaded>=0.5.12,<0.6
quantstats-lumi>=1.1.5,<2
```

New `observability` extra:

```text
structlog>=26.1,<27
opentelemetry-api>=1.44,<2
opentelemetry-sdk>=1.44,<2
```

`dev` extra additions:

```text
hypothesis>=6.161,<7
time-machine>=3.2,<4
```

`paper_runtime/pyproject.toml` (the root `pyproject.toml` no longer declares
a `paper` extra — see "Root `paper` extra removed" below):

```text
lumibot==4.5.78   (bumped from 4.5.74)
```

### Verified resolved versions (PyPI JSON API, 2026-07-26)

| Package | Verified version | Requires-Python |
|---|---|---|
| exchange_calendars | 4.13.2 | `>=3.10,<4` |
| TA-Lib | 0.7.1 | `>=3.9` |
| quantstats-lumi | 1.1.5 | `>=3.6` |
| empyrical-reloaded | 0.5.12 | `>=3.9` |
| structlog | 26.1.0 | `>=3.10` |
| opentelemetry-api | 1.44.0 | `>=3.10` |
| opentelemetry-sdk | 1.44.0 | `>=3.10` |
| hypothesis | 6.161.5 | `>=3.10` |
| time-machine | 3.2.0 | `>=3.10` |
| lumibot | 4.5.78 | `>=3.10` |

Full detail in `DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md` ("PR 1 re-verification" section) and
Section 6 ("PR 1 correction record").

### Python floor decision

**Unchanged, `>=3.10`,** in both `pyproject.toml` and
`paper_runtime/pyproject.toml`. The `>=3.11` floor proposed during PR 0 was
contingent solely on adding VectorBT; PR 1 does not add VectorBT, and every
package verified above supports `>=3.10`. Pyright's `pythonVersion` in both
`[tool.pyright]` blocks is unchanged (`3.10`). CI continues running on
Python 3.11, which is compatible with a `>=3.10` package floor.

### VectorBT licensing status

`BLOCKED_PENDING_LICENSE_DECISION` (recorded in `DECISIONS.md`). VectorBT
1.1.0 is Apache-2.0 with Commons Clause — source-available/fair-code, not
conventional OSI-approved open source, without an explicit owner-approved
exception. Not added to any dependency declaration in PR 1. PR 5 (retitled
"Vectorized research library selection and adapter") must evaluate an
OSI-approved alternative or obtain explicit owner approval before adding a
vectorized-research dependency.

### Riskfolio-Lib deferral

Not added in PR 1. Remains PR 12 evaluation-only. Its `vectorbt>=0.28.0`
hard dependency was re-verified against current PyPI metadata and confirmed
accurate (not a documentation error) — see `DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md` Section 6.

### TA-Lib wheel result

Confirmed: TA-Lib 0.7.1 provides prebuilt wheels for manylinux2014/
musllinux (x86_64/aarch64), macOS 13/14 (x86_64/arm64), and Windows across
cp39–cp314. `pip install -e ".[indicators]"` resolved a compatible wheel on
this machine (macOS arm64, Python 3.11) with no compilation and
`import talib` succeeded (`talib.__version__ == "0.7.1"`). `DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md`
and `MASTER_PLAN.md` corrected to require a wheel first, with system
installation only as an explicit fallback (PR 4 scope). This is now also a
blocking CI check (`dependency-extras-smoke` / `indicators` in `ci.yml`, on
`ubuntu-latest`), so the wheel result is a reproducible merge gate, not only
a local scratch-environment observation.

### Root `paper` extra removed (`DECISIONS.md` D5)

The root `pyproject.toml`'s `paper` extra was **removed**, not merely
version-bumped. `pip install -e ".[paper]"` cannot resolve for any
published `lumibot==4.5.x` release: LumiBot's `google-adk[extensions]`
requirement pulls in `litellm`, which pins `jsonschema==4.23.0` **exactly**
across every compatible release, unconditionally conflicting with this
repository's `jsonschema>=4.26.0` base floor. (An earlier diagnosis in this
PR incorrectly attributed the failure to a `google-genai` version-floor
mismatch between `lumibot` and `google-adk`; that mismatch is real but is
not the blocking constraint — bisecting each base dependency individually
against `lumibot==4.5.78` isolated `jsonschema>=4.26.0` as the actual
unsatisfiable constraint, confirmed by inspecting `litellm`'s wheel metadata
directly.) `docs/adr/0002-isolated-lumibot-runtime.md`'s Context section
already flagged this exact risk as a *silent downgrade* motivating the
`paper_runtime` process-boundary architecture; it has since become an
unconditional resolution failure now that `jsonschema>=4.26.0` is a hard
floor. `paper_runtime/pyproject.toml` is now the sole LumiBot dependency
declaration in the repository. `runtime/lumibot/adapter.py` (ADR 0001) and
its test (`tests/unit/test_lumibot_adapter.py`) are unaffected in behavior —
the test still guards itself with `pytest.importorskip("lumibot")` and a
developer who wants to exercise it installs `lumibot` into a scratch
virtualenv by hand, not via any declared extra.

### Environments tested

No Python 3.10 interpreter was available on this machine; all scratch
environments used Python 3.11 (the interpreter CI already uses), which is
compatible with the unchanged `>=3.10` floor.

- **Environment A (standard application, `.[dev]`):** installed cleanly;
  `import exchange_calendars, hypothesis, time_machine` succeeded; `pip
  check` reported no broken requirements; full offline suite —
  **2746 passed, 18 skipped, 0 failed**.
- **Environment B (`.[indicators]`):** installed cleanly; `import talib`
  succeeded (`0.7.1`); `pip check` clean.
- **Environment C (`.[analytics]`):** installed cleanly; `import empyrical,
  quantstats_lumi` succeeded (`0.5.12`, `1.1.5` — note the importable module
  is `quantstats_lumi`, not `quantstats`); `pip check` clean. No network
  calls or benchmark data were fetched.
- **Environment D (`.[observability]`):** installed cleanly; `import
  structlog; import opentelemetry.sdk` succeeded (`structlog 26.1.0`); `pip
  check` clean. No exporter configured.
- **Environment E (isolated `paper_runtime[dev]` — the only LumiBot install
  target that exists after this PR):** installed cleanly; `pip check`
  clean; resolved `lumibot==4.5.78`; paper_runtime suite —
  **59 passed, 0 failed**. The root `pyproject.toml` no longer declares a
  `paper` extra (see "Root `paper` extra removed" above), so there is no
  root-package LumiBot install path to validate separately, and no
  cross-distribution version assertion to make — `lumibot==4.5.78` is
  declared in exactly one place.
- Indicators/analytics/observability were never installed together in one
  combined environment, consistent with the isolation requirement. Each is
  now also independently re-verified on every PR by the
  `dependency-extras-smoke` CI matrix (`ci.yml`).
- A blocking `python-3-10-floor` CI job (`ci.yml`) now installs `.[dev]` and
  runs the full offline suite under the declared minimum Python version on
  every PR; no Python 3.10 interpreter was available on this development
  machine, so this substantiates the floor that local validation could not.

### Documentation corrections applied

- `exchange_calendars` corrected from a proposed optional `core` extra to a
  base application dependency (`DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md`, `pyproject.toml`).
- VectorBT reclassified `BLOCKED_PENDING_LICENSE_DECISION`; not added.
  PR 5 retitled from "VectorBT research adapter" to "Vectorized research
  library selection and adapter" (`MASTER_PLAN.md`, `DECISIONS.md`,
  `COMPONENT_MATRIX.md`).
- Riskfolio-Lib removed from the proposed PR 1 `analytics` group; remains
  PR 12 evaluation-only. Its VectorBT hard-dependency claim was re-verified
  and confirmed accurate, not corrected.
- TA-Lib installation guidance corrected from unconditional
  `brew install`/`apt install` to wheel-first with a documented,
  explicitly-triggered fallback (`DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md`, `MASTER_PLAN.md`).
- Analytics authority boundary made unambiguous: empyrical-reloaded is
  authoritative for primitive metrics; quantstats-lumi is reporting/
  presentation only.
- LumiBot version aligned to `4.5.78` in both `pyproject.toml` and
  `paper_runtime/pyproject.toml`.
- Python floor documentation corrected from "raise to `>=3.11`" to "remains
  `>=3.10` until an approved dependency requires a raise."
- The Pydantic ADR contradiction in `DECISIONS.md` (two inconsistent
  statements about when an ADR is required) replaced with one rule: PR 2
  adds no Pydantic dependency by default; an ADR is required only if PR 2
  recommends adopting Pydantic at a boundary, before adding the dependency.
- The "21 proposed libraries" count in this file, which did not match
  `DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md`'s 23 table entries, corrected above.
- This file no longer states the PR is `pyproject.toml only`.
- `DEPENDENCY_MATRIX.md` Section 1's VectorBT, TA-Lib, and LumiBot rows were
  edited in place to state the current decision directly, rather than
  leaving the superseded PR 0 proposal to contradict the corrections
  recorded later in the same document (a future read of only Section 1
  could otherwise reach the wrong conclusion).
- Root `paper` extra removed from `pyproject.toml` after review identified
  it as a declared, unresolvable install target (`DECISIONS.md` D5;
  `docs/adr/0002-isolated-lumibot-runtime.md` Amendment).
- `ci.yml` gained a blocking `dependency-extras-smoke` matrix (one job per
  new extra: `indicators`, `analytics`, `observability`, each installed
  alone) and a blocking `python-3-10-floor` job, so the new dependency
  groups and the declared Python floor are reproducible merge gates, not
  only local scratch-environment observations.

## Custom code removed

None. PR 1 changed no behavior under `src/`, `scripts/`,
`paper_runtime/src/`, `tests/`, or `config/`. The one edit under `tests/`
(`tests/unit/test_lumibot_adapter.py`) is a docstring/skip-reason text
update reflecting the removed `paper` extra — the test's guard
(`pytest.importorskip("lumibot")`) and its pass/skip behavior are
unchanged.

## Library authority established

None yet beyond dependency declaration. No production code imports any PR 1
dependency; PR 3/4/11/15/16 wire the respective libraries into code.

## Tests run

- Main offline suite (Environment A): **2746 passed, 18 skipped, 0 failed.**
- `paper_runtime` suite (Environment E2): **59 passed, 0 failed.**
- No test file under `tests/` or `paper_runtime/tests/` was modified.

## Remaining blockers

1. **LumiBot-backtest-mode import-boundary question** (`DECISIONS.md` D4,
   open item 1) must be resolved before PR 6 starts. Not a blocker for
   PR 1 or PR 2.
2. **PR 13/14 feasibility outcomes** (SQLAlchemy/Alembic trigger-safety,
   APScheduler lease-coexistence) are unknown until those PRs run — PR 1
   does not depend on them.

The root `.[paper]` extra `ResolutionImpossible` finding from an earlier
draft of this PR is resolved, not deferred: the extra was removed (see
"Root `paper` extra removed" above and `DECISIONS.md` D5), so there is no
outstanding blocker to track for it.

## Completed work (PR 2)

**Scope:** evaluation only — `docs/library-migration/pr2/EVALUATION.md`
(full inventory, comparison, and recommendation),
`docs/library-migration/pr2/boundary_comparison_scratch.py` and
`comparison_output.txt` (scratch Pydantic v2 comparison implementation, not
merged into `src/`), and this file. No file under `src/`, `scripts/`,
`paper_runtime/src/`, or `tests/` was modified.

**Outcome: do not adopt.** Every untrusted-input boundary (YAML config
loading across 9 modules, CLI argument parsing, the JSONL broker protocol,
and external provider response parsing) was inventoried in
`docs/library-migration/pr2/EVALUATION.md`. A scratch Pydantic v2
implementation of the two highest-stakes boundaries
(`runtime/paper_runtime_config.py`, `paper_runtime/.../protocol.py`) showed:
dependency/performance impact is low (4 lightweight transitive packages,
~3.7us/call, no material perf difference); Pydantic's `extra="forbid"` gives
unknown-field rejection for free, but every safety-critical boundary already
implements this by hand; the safety-critical business-rule validators
(`real_money_enabled` must be false, pinned base URL, exact allowed-sides/
order-types) do not shrink under Pydantic — they relocate into
`field_validator` methods of equal size, producing a longer implementation
overall. No boundary showed the "clear reduction in custom
boundary-validation code" required by `DECISIONS.md` D2's adoption bar.
**No `pydantic` dependency was added to `pyproject.toml`. No ADR was
required or drafted**, per the single ADR rule in `DECISIONS.md` D2 (an ADR
is needed only if adoption is recommended).

Non-blocking gaps identified for future cleanup (not part of this PR, no new
dependency needed): `analysis/scorer.py`, `analysis/screener.py`, and
`execution/config.py` do not reject unknown YAML keys, unlike most other
loaders; `scripts/indicators.py` and `scripts/score.py` perform no shape
validation of their JSON input, unlike `scripts/macro_pillar.py`.

## Next PR

**PR 3 — exchange_calendars migration.**
