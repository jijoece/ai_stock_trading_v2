# Milestone 9.3 — Evidence integrity and controlled soak campaign

> Milestone 9.3.1 supersedes the original single-execution details below with resumable campaign
> attempts, cutoff-frozen refreshable reviews, UTC/session validation, historically bounded
> verification, and qualifying provider-cycle semantics. See
> [Campaign resumability and point-in-time integrity](milestone9-3-1-campaign-resumability-and-point-in-time-integrity.md).

Milestone 10 consumes the immutable activation-review output through a separate two-step, explicitly queued local-paper scheduler. See [Recurring Local Paper Trading](../runbooks/recurring-local-paper-trading.md); Milestone 9.3 itself remains manual and advisory-only.

Milestone 9.3 corrects the remaining Milestone 9.2 evidence gaps and adds a manually invoked,
multi-date local paper campaign. It does not schedule work, call providers, submit to an external
broker, promote an experiment arm, or enable live trading.

## Evidence-integrity corrections

Provider activity now carries a normalized outcome: `SUCCEEDED`, `PARTIAL`, `FAILED`,
`SOURCE_UNAVAILABLE`, `ATTEMPTED`, or `UNKNOWN`. Evidence `ok`/`success`/`succeeded`/
`complete`/`completed`/`available` values are successful. Claude is successful only when its
actual orchestration status is `COMPLETED`/`SUCCEEDED`/`ok`. Incomplete analyst-only runs are
partial; timeouts, exhaustion, invalid responses, and hard failures are failures. Only successful
real-provider cycles satisfy the controlled-readiness floor. `cost_usd` remains budget, pricing,
and reporting evidence; it is not provider identity in controlled readiness.

Provider history begins with every `research_cycles.status=COMPLETED` row at or before the cutoff.
A completed cycle without usable provenance is `UNKNOWN`, so the six category counts always sum
to completed-cycle history. Partial, failed, and running research cycles are reported separately.
Evidence facts remain immutable; `research_cycle_provider_provenance_links` append-only links them
to the resulting research run once its ID exists.

Controlled readiness evaluates every safe check before choosing a primary status. Primary priority
is kill, pause, unexplained health pause, critical alerts, lifecycle failure, reconciliation,
valuation, sample history, cross-book failure, successful-provider history, then inherited shadow
readiness. JSON exposes `all_failed_checks`, `blocking_checks`, `advisory_checks`, and
`missing_checks`.

Cross-book verification now persists a stable scope ID and a verification ID derived from that
scope plus policy, deterministic source state, and normalized checks. Changed state creates a new
immutable event; frozen state is idempotent. Checks now include event-specific settlement
references, unexpected book namespaces, and position/open-lot quantity reconciliation. A stored
verification whose source-state hash no longer matches the requested cutoff is `STALE` for
readiness and cannot satisfy recurring-review readiness.

## Campaign

`paper_books.soak_campaign` is optional and disabled by default. Its strict schema includes market
day, completed-cycle, successful-real-provider, unresolved-warning, and stop-on-blocker policy.
The complete section contributes to the campaign configuration hash.

The bounded JSON manifest contains one campaign ID and strictly increasing timezone-aware dates.
Each date has an explicit cycle-ID list; an empty list is a valid lifecycle-only day. Unknown keys,
duplicate dates or cycle IDs, non-aware timestamps, and oversized manifests fail closed. There is
no cycle discovery.

`run_soak_campaign` processes dates in order through the shared `run_controlled_soak_day` service:
explicit integration, lifecycle, verification, all-check readiness, and immutable day evidence.
Every effective market timestamp uses the manifest date. Wall time is audit metadata only. Early
sample insufficiency continues the campaign; safety blockers stop later dates by default, while
`--continue-on-blocker` is an explicit override to continue collecting evidence.

Persistence is additive: `paper_soak_campaigns`, `paper_soak_campaign_days`, and
`paper_soak_activation_reviews`. IDs/hashes are deterministic and rows are immutable. Replaying an
identical completed campaign returns the persisted evidence without duplicating rows. The final
recommendation is one of `INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE`, `CONTINUE_MANUAL_SOAK`,
`BLOCKED_REQUIRES_REMEDIATION`, or `READY_FOR_RECURRING_ACTIVATION_REVIEW`; all are advisory.

## Milestone 9.3.1 corrections

The campaign header is now a definition and each execution is a separate attempt. Continuation
requires an operator and reason, creates a new attempt, preserves earlier attempt/day rows, skips
completed dates, and resumes retry-safe dates. A `RUNNING` attempt is crash-recoverable; uncertain
partially persisted mutation becomes `RECOVERY_REQUIRES_REVIEW`.

Reviews are immutable state-sensitive events with explicit supersession. Their evidence is limited
to campaign-associated IDs and the campaign cutoff. Alerts, pause state, cost, comparisons,
promotion evidence, reconciliations, valuations, and final positions do not consult unrestricted
current state. Normal dates must be trading sessions at or after regular New York close;
non-trading lifecycle-only dates require an explicit flag and empty cycle IDs. Early closes remain
an offline-calendar limitation.

The successful-provider counter remains available for reporting, but controlled readiness uses the
stricter qualifying count: all observed real-provider outcomes for the completed cycle must succeed.
Historical cross-book checks use cutoff-bounded immutable evidence and report insufficient data
when reconstruction is unsafe.
