# Documentation Index

Use this index before opening milestone documents. It identifies the smallest
authoritative document set for a task and prevents older implementation plans
from being mistaken for current behavior.

## Authority order

When sources disagree, use this order:

1. Current code, tests, schemas, and configuration
2. Accepted architecture decision records (ADRs)
3. Current operational runbooks
4. `README.md` and the architecture overview
5. Milestone implementation and developer guides
6. Audits, pending-work notes, and research material

Milestone documents explain how and why a capability was introduced. They are
historical context, not an override of current code or accepted ADRs. Do not
read multiple milestone variants unless the task requires comparing them.
